# VelocityViaUpdater
Updates ViaVersion, ViaBackwards and ViaRewind for Velocity automatically

How this works & How to use:
Specify the path of the 3 plugins by modifying the code. On first run, the program will delete them and replace with the latest version. The version numbers will be recorded on a txt file (you can change its path, modify the code.) Then, it checks for new updates every minute and updates when it found new versions. Wrote 99% with AI, functions well (at least for me), thought somebody else might need it so I uploaded it here.
